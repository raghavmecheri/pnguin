## DataFrames made simple again
pnguin is a feature rich, minimalist and modular DataFrame library, capable of working both with good 'ol CSV files, as well as with remote databases

## The pnguin mindset
pnguin's extreme simplicity makes it the easiest DataFrame library to perform custom operations on. With support for both row and column indexing, and powerful core functionality built in, pnguin serves as a simple, one-stop shop for your DataFrame needs. *Oh, and we support remote connections.*

## The Promise of Small
Inspired by [Geohot](https://github.com/geohot)'s [TinyGrad](https://github.com/geohot/tinygrad), this repository will never exceed a 1000 lines of code. If it does, we will revert PRs until the repository's source code is less than or equal to 1000 lines.

## Misc

## Why pnguin?
Well, Penguins are cute. Pandas are cute. This is a Pandas alternative, and the name _penguin_ was taken. So I just got rid of the _e_ :)
